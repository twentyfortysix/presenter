# Presenter helps present website concepts in bowser.

The presenter is a simple script that creates a page with menu for all images uploaded into the "img" folder.
The practical usage is that you create all the website views as screenshots (*.jpg) with appropriate names such as "homepage", "article detail", what ever you like. The menu is populated by the names of images with appropriate links to them.

## Picture naming:
In order to avoid the problems with spaces in names and diacritics. Do not use diacritics, and write the dashes instead of spaces.

## The menu naming:
All underscores and dashes in file names are replaced by spaces in menu item names.

## Content:
Pictures are stretched accross the browser in its full width. Sure it is px:px but still more realistic than pdf view (in some cases). 

## How to use it:
Upload the "index.php", "style.css" and "img" folder to your hosting. Upload screens to the "img" folder.
Open the url with index.php in browser.

## Presenter helps present website concepts in browser.

The presenter is a simple script that creates a page with menu for all images uploaded into the "img" folder.
The practical usage is that you create all the website views as screenshots (*.jpg) with appropriate names such as "homepage", "article detail", what ever you like. The menu is populated by the names of images with appropriate links to them.
When user selects an menu item (image) in the menu, the menu stays put and only the image is reloaded on the background.
Don't worry each picture view has its own url .)

#### Picture naming:
In order to avoid the problems with spaces in names and diacritics. Do not use diacritics, and write the dashes instead of spaces.

#### The menu naming:
All underscores and dashes in file names are replaced by spaces in menu item names.

#### Content:
Pictures are stretched accross the browser in its full width. Sure it is px:px but still more realistic than pdf view (in some cases). 

#### How to use it:
Upload the "index.php", "style.css" and "img" folder to your hosting. Upload screens to the "img" folder.
Open the url with index.php in browser.

Presenter helps present website concepts in bowser.

The presenter is a simple script that creates a page with menu for all images uploaded into the "img" folder.
The practical usage is that you create all the website views as screenshots (*.jpg) with appropriate names such as "homepage", "article detail", what ever you like. The menu is populated by the names of images with appropriate links to them.

The menu naming:
All underscores and dashes in file names are replaced by spaces in menu item names.

Content:
Pictures are stretched accross the browser in its full width. Sure it is px:px but still more realistic than pdf view (in some cases). 

How to use it:
Upload the ijdex.php, style.css and "img" foder to your hosting. Upload screens to the "img" folder.
Open the url with index.phop in browser. Present.
